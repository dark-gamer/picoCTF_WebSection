flag is hidden in http://mercury.picoctf.net:21939/

First I try to recon the site.There are who webpages are visible at a time,red and blue.I try to find robots.txt file...nothing found.Then I read source code,I notice red button is working with "GET" method and blue button is working with "POST" method.So I try to change the method to "PUT"....I discover a white page....I randomly Choose methods without GET & POST....each time gets white page.Then I change my methodology,Going to Burp Suite I try a sniper attack a payload containing different Methods....I got Page Length is very small for "HEAD"....then access the Head ,I got my desired flag.
